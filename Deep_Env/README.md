*Deep learning hand made recipe*. Combined with different env ingredients and useful tools such as

#### NOTE:

- To activate SSH remote function, please first publish the available port on the Docker host and map it to port 22 in the container (e.g. `-p 10022:22`).  Then add command `/etc/init.d/ssh restart` when running the image. And you can test the internal container connection with root user by tapping `ssh root@docker-host-ip -p 10022`
